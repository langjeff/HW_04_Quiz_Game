# Requirements & Use-Case

The purpose of this application is to build a multiple choice test using javascript DOM manipulations and web API's.

- the page will load with a start button
- upon clicking the start button, the first question will display, and a countdown timer will start.
- the user will select an answer.
- if the answer is correct, the user will have 5 seconds added to the timer.
- if the answer is incorrect, 10 seconds will be taken off the timer.
- an alert will notify the user if they gave the correct or incorrect answer.
- if the user runs out of time, the game will end.
- after answering all questions, the program will display the user score and ask them if they would like to save that score.
- they may then restart the game.
- a link to view high scores will display all saved high scores.
